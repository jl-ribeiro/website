    title: "About Me",
    paragraph1: "My passion is to act as a 'full-stack' data engineer, solving end-to-end problems, from ingestion and modeling to creating data products. My non-linear professional journey, with experience in high-complexity operations like aviation, has given me a unique ability to see beyond the code.",
    paragraph2: "This background allows me to deeply understand operational pain points, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and adapt solutions across different industriesâ€”like transforming an airport logistics model into a B2C retail solution. I build data solutions that are not only technically robust but also solve real business problems.",
